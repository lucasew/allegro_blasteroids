  <summary>Destroy as many asteroids as possible</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      A simple game where the goal is to destroy as many asteroids as possible.
      The game generates a new asteroid every 10 seconds with random health, rotation speed, and velocity.
      The player destroys asteroids by shooting from the spaceship using the space key.
      Shots have random speed and damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can shoot like Rambo to destroy the asteroids, but be aware that shots lose 1 damage per second,
      and they can even have negative damage and increase the life of asteroids!
    </p>
    <p>
      Collisions are calculated by distance, so it's possible that visually a bullet passes through an
      asteroid without dealing damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you die, the game closes, returning the game time and how many points you scored.
